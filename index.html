		<p class="bodytext"> <b>Photography</b> is the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"> science </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"> art </a>, application and practice of creating durable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"> images </a> by recording <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"> light </a> or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. </p>

		<p class="bodytext"> Typically, a <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)""> lens </a> is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is <b> electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing </b>. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a <b>print</b>, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing. </p>

		<p class="bodytext"> Photography is employed in many fields of <i>science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business,</i> as well as its more direct uses for <i>art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.</i> </p>

<h1> <a name="etymology"> Etymology </a></h1>
<hr>
  <p class="bodytext"> The word "photography" was created from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"> Greek </a> roots φωτός (phōtos), genitive of φῶς (phōs), "light"[2] and γραφή (graphé) "representation by means of lines" or "drawing",[3] together meaning "drawing with light".[4] </p>

  <p class="bodytext"> Several people may have coined the same new term from these roots independently. Hercules Florence, a French painter and inventor living in Campinas, Brazil, used the French form of the word, photographie, in private notes which a Brazilian historian believes were written in 1834.[5] Johann von Maedler, a Berlin astronomer, is credited in a 1932 German history of photography as having used it in an article published on 25 February 1839 in the German newspaper Vossische Zeitung.[6] Both of these claims are now widely reported but apparently neither has ever been independently confirmed as beyond reasonable doubt. Credit has traditionally been given to Sir John Herschel both for coining the word and for introducing it to the public. His uses of it in private correspondence prior to 25 February 1839 and at his Royal Society lecture on the subject in London on 14 March 1839 have long been amply documented and accepted as settled facts. </p>

<h2> <a name="precursor"> Precursor technologies </a></h2>
 
 <div class="textwrapper"> Photography is the result of combining several technical discoveries. Long before the first photographs were made, ancient Han Chinese philosopher Mo Di from the Mohist School of Logic was the first to discover and develop the scientific principles of optics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language">camera obscura </a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera"> pinhole camera </a>. Later Greek mathematicians Aristotle and Euclid also independently described a pinhole camera in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. In the 6th century CE, Byzantine mathematician Anthemius of Tralles used a type of camera obscura in his experiments, Both the Han Chinese polymath Shen Kuo (1031–95) and Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) (965–1040) independently invented the camera obscura and pinhole camera, Albertus Magnus (1193–1280) discovered silver nitrate, and Georg Fabricius (1516–71) discovered silver chloride. Shen Kuo explains the science of camera obscura and optical physics in his scientific work Dream Pool Essays while the techniques described in Ibn al-Haytham's Book of Optics are capable of producing primitive photographs using medieval materials.

  <p> Daniele Barbaro described a diaphragm in 1566.[16] Wilhelm Homberg described how light darkened some chemicals (photochemical effect) in 1694. The fiction book Giphantie, published in 1760, by French author Tiphaigne de la Roche, described what can be interpreted as photography.</p>

<br>

  <p class="bodytext"> The discovery of the camera obscura that provides an image of a scene dates back to ancient China. Leonardo da Vinci mentions natural camera obscura that are formed by dark caves on the edge of a sunlit valley. A hole in the cave wall will act as a pinhole camera and project a laterally reversed, upside down image on a piece of paper. So the birth of photography was primarily concerned with inventing means to capture and keep the image produced by the camera obscura. </p>

  <p class="bodytext"> Renaissance painters used the camera obscura which, in fact, gives the optical rendering in color that dominates Western Art. The camera obscura literally means "dark chamber" in Latin. It is a box with a hole in it which allows light to go through and create an image onto the piece of paper. </p>

<h2> <a name="invention"> Invention of photography </a></h2>

  <div class="niepcewrapper"> 
  <img class= "niepce" src= "images/niepce.jpg" alt="niepce">
  <br>
    <p class="caption"> Earliest known surviving heliographic engraving, 1825, printed from a metal plate made by Nicéphore Niépce.[18] The plate was exposed under an ordinary engraving and copied it by photographic means. This was a step towards the first permanent photograph taken with a camera. </p></div>

   <div id="bodytext2">
   <p> Around the year 1800, British inventor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wedgwood_(photographer)">Thomas Wedgwood </a> made the first known attempt to capture the image in a camera obscura by means of a light-sensitive substance. He used paper or white leather treated with silver nitrate. Although he succeeded in capturing the shadows of objects placed on the surface in direct sunlight, and even made shadow copies of paintings on glass, it was reported in 1802 that "the images formed by means of a camera obscura have been found too faint to produce, in any moderate time, an effect upon the nitrate of silver." The shadow images eventually darkened all over.[19] </p> 

   <p> The first permanent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography"> photoetching </a> was an image produced in 1822 by the French inventor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicéphore_Niépce"> Nicéphore Niépce </a>, but it was destroyed in a later attempt to make prints from it.[18] Niépce was successful again in 1825. In 1826 or 1827, he made the View from the Window at Le Gras, the earliest surviving photograph from nature (i.e., of the image of a real-world scene, as formed in a camera obscura by a lens). </p>

   <p> Because Niépce's camera photographs required an extremely long exposure (at least eight hours and probably several days), he sought to greatly improve his bitumen process or replace it with one that was more practical. In partnership with Louis Daguerre, he worked out post-exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more light-sensitive resin, but hours of exposure in the camera were still required. With an eye to eventual commercial exploitation, the partners opted for total secrecy. </p>
</div>

<br>
  <p class="bodytext"> Niépce died in 1833 and Daguerre then redirected the experiments toward the light-sensitive silver halides, which Niépce had abandoned many years earlier because of his inability to make the images he captured with them light-fast and permanent. Daguerre's efforts culminated in what would later be named the daguerreotype process. The essential elements—a silver-plated surface sensitized by iodine vapor, developed by mercury vapor, and "fixed" with hot saturated salt water—were in place in 1837. The required exposure time was measured in minutes instead of hours. Daguerre took the earliest confirmed photograph of a person in 1838 while capturing a view of a Paris street: unlike the other pedestrian and horse-drawn traffic on the busy boulevard, which appears deserted, one man having his boots polished stood sufficiently still throughout the several-minutes-long exposure to be visible. The existence of Daguerre's process was publicly announced, without details, on 7 January 1839. The news created an international sensation. France soon agreed to pay Daguerre a pension in exchange for the right to present his invention to the world as the gift of France, which occurred when complete working instructions were unveiled on 19 August 1839. In that same year, American photographer Robert Cornelius is credited with taking the earliest surviving photographic self-portrait. </p>


  <p class="bodytext"> A latticed window in Lacock Abbey, England, photographed by William Fox Talbot in 1835. Shown here in positive form, this may be the oldest extant photographic negative made in a camera.
In Brazil, Hercules Florence had apparently started working out a silver-salt-based paper process in 1832, later naming it Photographie. </p>

  <p class="bodytext"> Meanwhile, a British inventor, William Fox Talbot, had succeeded in making crude but reasonably light-fast silver images on paper as early as 1834 but had kept his work secret. After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the camera, but in 1840 he created the calotype process, which used the chemical development of a latent image to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent negative which could be used to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as Daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera. Talbot's famous tiny paper negative of the Oriel window in Lacock Abbey, one of a number of camera photographs he made in the summer of 1835, may be the oldest camera negative in existence.</p>

  <p class="bodytext"> British chemist John Herschel made many contributions to the new field. He invented the cyanotype process, later familiar as the "blueprint". He was the first to use the terms "photography", "negative" and "positive". He had discovered in 1819 that sodium thiosulphate was a solvent of silver halides, and in 1839 he informed Talbot (and, indirectly, Daguerre) that it could be used to "fix" silver-halide-based photographs and make them completely light-fast. He made the first glass negative in late 1839. </p>

  <p class="bodytext"> In the March 1851 issue of The Chemist, Frederick Scott Archer published his wet plate collodion process. It became the most widely used photographic medium until the gelatin dry plate, introduced in the 1870s, eventually replaced it. There are three subsets to the collodion process; the Ambrotype (a positive image on glass), the Ferrotype or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive prints on albumen or salted paper. </p>

  <p class="bodytext"> Many advances in photographic glass plates and printing were made during the rest of the 19th century. In 1891, Gabriel Lippmann introduced a process for making natural-color photographs based on the optical phenomenon of the interference of light waves. His scientifically elegant and important but ultimately impractical invention earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908.</p>

  <p class="bodytext"> Glass plates were the medium for most original camera photography from the late 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized amateur photography, early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old. Because of the superior dimensional stability of glass, the use of plates for some scientific applications, such as astrophotography, continued into the 1990s, and in the niche field of laser holography, it has persisted into the 2010s.</p>

<h1> <a name="production"> Modes of production </a></h1>
<hr> 
<h2> <a name="amateur"> Amateur </a></h2>

  <p class="bodytext"> An amateur photographer is one who practices photography as a hobby/passion and not for profit. The quality of some amateur work is comparable to that of many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional">professionals </a> and may be highly specialized or eclectic in choice of subjects. Amateur photography is often pre-eminent in photographic subjects which have little prospect of commercial use or reward. Amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the hand-held camera.[43] Nowadays it has spread widely through social media and is carried out throughout different platforms and equipment, switching to the use of cell phone as a key tool for making photography more accessible to everyone. </p>

<h2> <a name="commercial"> Commercial </a></h2>

 <p class="bodytext"> Commercial photography is probably best defined as any photography for which the photographer is paid for images rather than works of art. In this light, money could be paid for the subject of the photograph or the photograph itself. Wholesale, retail, and professional uses of photography would fall under this definition. The commercial photographic world could include: </p>

<ul class="bodytext"> 

  <li>Advertising photography: photographs made to illustrate and usually sell a service or product. These images, such as packshots, are generally done with an advertising agency, design firm or with an in-house corporate design team. </li>
  <li> Fashion and glamour photography usually incorporates models and is a form of advertising photography. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_photography"> Fashion photography</a>, like the work featured in Harper's Bazaar, emphasizes clothes and other products; glamour emphasizes the model and body form. Glamour photography is popular in advertising and men's magazines. Models in glamour photography sometimes work nude </li>
  <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_photography"> Concert Photography </a> focuses on capturing candid images of both the artist or band as well as the atmosphere (including the crowd). Many of these photographers work freelance and are contracted through an artist or their management to cover a specific show. Concert photographs are often used to promote the artist or band in addition to the venue. </li>
  <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_photography">Crime scene photography </a> consists of photographing scenes of crime such as robberies and murders. A black and white camera or an infrared camera may be used to capture specific details.</li>
  <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_life_photography">Still life photography </a> usually depicts inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which may be either natural or man-made. Still life is a broader category for food and some natural photography and can be used for advertising purposes.</li>
  <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_photography"> Food photography </a> can be used for editorial, packaging or advertising use. Food photography is similar to still life photography but requires some special skills. </li>
  <li>Editorial photography illustrates a story or idea within the context of a magazine. These are usually assigned by the magazine and encompass fashion and glamour photography features. 
    <ul>
     <li>Photojournalism can be considered a subset of editorial photography. Photographs made in this context are accepted as a documentation of a news story. </li>
     </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Portrait and wedding photography: photographs made and sold directly to the end user of the images.
Landscape photography depicts locations.</li>
  <li> Wildlife photography demonstrates the life of animals. </li>
  <li> Paparazzi is a form of photojournalism in which the photographer captures candid images of athletes, celebrities, politicians, and other prominent people. </li>
  <li> Pet photography involves several aspects that are similar to traditional studio portraits. It can also be done in natural lighting, outside of a studio, such as in a client's home. </li>
